<p id="bkmrk-nice-to-see-you-here-1" class="align-left">Nice to see you here. I am Caelan, a technology professional based in Vancouver.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p id="bkmrk-like-many-people-in-" class="align-left">Like many people in tech, I have been tinkering my whole life. From a very young age I was happily doing things like getting Linux distributions running (<a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LFS </a>anyone?) to hosting my own services.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p id="bkmrk-during-earlier-years" class="align-left">I coached Competitive Gymnastics for a bit over 10 years, however when COVID came around it made that field of work a challenge. It was at this point I switched to working in tech.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p id="bkmrk-a-few-years-later%2C-i" class="align-left">A few years later, I have established myself as a Solutions Architect, though titles like Senior Systems Administrator/Engineer, Cloud Administrator/Engineer, Projects Engineer, Sales Engineer, and others in that vein would also be appropriate - I find myself wearing a lot of hats in my daily work.&nbsp;<br></p>

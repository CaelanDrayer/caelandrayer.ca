I have been working at sea! Quite nice. 

I have a server at home in Vancouver that technically hosts & does everything. A laptop to securely connect to it - and I am working in Canada! Technically, being on a Canadian flagged yacht also puts me in Canadian jurisdiction (well; once outside of territorial waters...).

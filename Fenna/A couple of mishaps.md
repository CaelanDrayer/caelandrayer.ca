# A couple of mishaps

## A bit of a tow 

We have had our share of mishaps. We encountered our first - and so far worst calamity very early on. We had been motoring around getting a feel for the yacht - when the engine cut out. No problem, we can troubleshoot that. After about an hour of faffing about - I still couldn't get the engine going. Alright, we can sail it in. Not ideal considering this would be our first time ever properly sailing the boat - but it would work. At a minimum, it will bring us closer to the town where would could ask for assistance. 

This started just fine, and was actually quite pleasant - a nice 15 knot wind pushing us along. As we got closer to the relatively tight channel, there was a thought - lets just test the process of bringing the sails in. Since we are going to be operating in tight, shallow waters - best we have at least practiced this maneuver. This was when things went from bad to worse. 

This yacht has hydraulic winches & furlers. We had tested these before we went out. They decided that right then was when they needed to fail. All of these hydraulic systems also have manual overrides. We had also tested these before. The wind had picked up, and was blowing us to shore with a nice 25 knots of wind. 

We managed to get the main sail in. Then we tried to get the Genoa in. This was when we learned that the furler for the foresail that should have wrapped the Genoa nicely around the forestay - was completely broken. With no engine, no hydraulics, no manual overrides, and a massive Genoa flapping about in decent winds; we decided discretion was the greater part of valor - and called for a tow in.

You can see our awkward drift & zigzag here:

For the engine, it turns out that the switch that controlled the pump for the day tank had stopped working. This tank then emptied and the whole system ran dry. There is supposed to be an alarm for this (we have the manual for the alarm, a hand drawn diagram & everything...), however I suspect that this mythical alarm is aspirational at best. You are also supposed to be able to flip two handles and have it roll over to the main tank. The challenge here is that you need to bleed the system. By the manual, there is a tiny little lever on the lift pump that you can use to bleed the system. In practice - this is ineffective. We later had a local mechanic show us a trick - if you use the starter, it will run the lift pump - Just be careful not to burn out your starter motor. 

For the foresail - the hydraulic furler had completely broken. It had to be completely removed & shipped to Athens for a complete overhaul & rebuild. Nothing much we could do there. 

## an oily situation

One of the first bits of maintenance we did was an overhaul of the generator. It was in real need of a service - the heat exchanger was completely clogged. The coolant was more particles than liquid, and the rest of it was in a surprisingly rough condition considering it really only had 1300 hours on it. We swapped all the fluids, changed the impeller, gave it a good cleaning - the works. 

This turned out to be a mistake. Almost immediately, it proved to be troublesome. The diesel lines in kept sucking air - causing it to shut off randomly. The filters that had been left with the boat didn't fit quite right - causing an oily mess.

The worst problem however, was that it seemed like every single gasket had simultaneously failed. The generator now had a slow, consistent leak - with the core of it being between the dynamo & the engine block. This generator was a large, bulky thing - near impossible to properly work, even in our admittedly large engine room. This oil leak caused other problems as well. Right below the generator - and more importantly below a hole in its catch pan lives the shift linkage for the main engine.

> On our way to anchor we heard a weird radio call on 16. Someone calling out a [pan-pan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-pan) with a curious message - "I am in the fish". This turned out to be a some poor souls who had gone straight into one of the local fish farms. Still not quite sure how they pulled that off - however we did end up seeing them as they were pulled out by the coast guard. We ended up following them into the anchorage - where the authorities lingered around their boat to "chat" for a good while. 

You can imagine my surprise when I was attempted to maneuver to anchor - and the throttle no longer does anything. Happily - I was right near the anchorage at this point. A bit of inertia, a bit of the bow thruster, and I managed to get an "alright" spot. Only mildly stressful - especially considering the Greek coast guard was right in front of us dealing with another boat who was "in the fish" a moment prior. 

The oil had leaked onto the linkage, and had slowly come out. A couple twists of the wrench - and the throttle was back in action. Happily a quick fix.

## inflatable no longer 
Our next issue was another nuisance - a spun prop on the outboard. It just happened to time itself when I had some guests come by. Not ideal. An easy fix - just had to wait for parts. 

It was when we had other guests that the next problem cropped up. The tender that had come with the boat (circa 2003) decided that it no longer needed air in one of its compartments. We had been looking at its seams with concern prior - and it gave me quite the surprise when this decided to give.

I tried a bit of a bodge - however with a rip of that size, in that place, without proper tools (and minimal know-how) this was a futile effort at best.

A new dingy would have to be acquired! Once our guests left. Of course this always seemed to happen when we had guests. 


## You cant park here
Unlike a car, boats tend to move - even when parked. This turned out to be a rather fun challenge - how & where do you place your boat in the busy anchorages off the coast of Greece. 

### Lakka
The town of Lakka, on the island of Paxos is gorgeous. It is every bit an idyllic seaside town. It is a great anchorage, and very conveniently placed between the larger towns of Preveza/Lefkada & Corfu.  

This anchorage tight. Very tight. A fun example of that below, where these boats are happily smacking into each other as they spin around their anchors.

We had our own fun with this one night as well. We had dropped anchor earlier in the day as far to the edge as possible - both to maximize the available space & to try and have as few people at risk of bumping into us as possible. 

A bigger (25m) motorboat anchored right beside us - close, but with what passes for enough room in a place like this. Great! No reasonable person would think to anchor between us, so we could relax. Then came the most dreaded of things - a charter catamaran. They came in between us and the motorboat, dropped anchor and immediately went for dinner. Five minutes later, the catamaran was up bumping against the motorboat. 

We finished changing out of swimwear so that we could go for dinner and paused to watch the people on the motorboat trying to signal to anyone on the catamaran that there was a problem - no luck. Then the catamaran started swinging our direction.

With two hulls, catamarans do not behave the same as monohulls at anchor. Two monohulls can reasonably expect to have a similar swing pattern on the anchor. A catamaran is different. Even then - they were too close. We had known that this anchorage was tight, and people did silly things - so we had all our fenders out. In a unique twist of fate, this was turned out to be unnecessary - our davits were the perfect height to make a couple nice dents in their boat, keeping our boat just far enough away. In a contest of fiberglass vs steel - steel wins. 

As the boat swung back towards the motor yacht, the people who had chartered this yacht came back from dinner - to some choice words from the people on the motorboat. This encouraged them to re-anchor a bit further away - and let us feel safe enough to go for dinner.

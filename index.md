# Hello!
<img align="right" src="/attachments/caelan_portrait_large.jpeg" alt="caelan_portrait_large" width="200vw">
## About Me
Nice to see you here. I am Caelan, a technology professional based in Vancouver.

Like many people in tech, I have been tinkering my whole life. From a very young age I was happily doing things like getting Linux distributions running (cutting my teeth on things like [LFS](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)) to hosting my own services.   

I coached Competitive Gymnastics for a bit over 10 years, however when COVID came around it made that field of work a challenge. It was at this point I switched to working in tech.   

A few years later, I have established myself as a Solutions Architect, though titles like Senior Systems Administrator/Engineer, Cloud Administrator/Engineer, Projects Engineer, Sales Engineer, and others in that vein would also be appropriate - I find myself wearing a lot of hats in my daily work.

## Business Highlights

I work with & oversee a team of of 4-12 with whom I enjoy providing expertise, guidance and support.   

I collaborate extensively with senior management/executives (both internal and external) to define, scope, & deliver solutions that include: SaaS tools, ERP Systems, CX platforms, cloud & physical infrastructure, cybersecurity enhancements, networking, endpoint management, identity access management, email security, & operational support.

I am heavily involved in all the moving parts required to bring a new solution to full operational status. I handle everything from: engaging stakeholders to determining business needs, solution evaluations, design & architecture documents, quoting, planning & coordination, technical configuration, operational hand-offs & end user training.

I also serve as an escalation point for senior leadership of clients & internally (including VPs and C-Suite), managing issue resolution, incident response, remediation planning, and impact assessments.

Recognized by clients for my ability to clearly & effectively communicate & handle competing priorities in a sometimes stressful operational environment.
